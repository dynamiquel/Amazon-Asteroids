This exercise contains an incomplete Asteroids game, implemented with SDL2 (you can find the documentation for SDL2 at https://wiki.libsdl.org/).

Tasks:
- Fix any bugs and performance issues with the current code.
- Modify the code architecture if you feel it can be improved, in any way you feel fit.
- Document your work explaining your changes and decisions in asteroids/Worklog.txt (This will be used in conjunction with your code/comments to better understand the decisions you've made)
- Clearly comment any modifications you made to the code.
- Complete the game by adding missing functionality, endgame conditions, mechanics, enemies or any other features you may consider.
  Some ideas (you don't necessarily need to do these):
  - Original asteroids Ship controls (rotation and thrust)
  - Screen wrapping
  - Score
  - Lives
  - Win / Game Over logic
  - ..etc..

There is no hard time limit for this task other than the due date.
